# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - Leon Renner

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [October 24, Thursday, 2019].

## Log

### R1D1 
**Today's progress:** Created a small app which gets multiple webpage ids through an API and afterwards calls the details 
of each webpage (title, URL). The titles are then shown in a list view and when clicking on them,
the webpage get's opened in a webview inside the app.
I've also set up GitHub to log my progress.

### R1D2
**Today's progress:** Mainly worked on my new website. I implemented a new theme and manipulated some parts of the theme
to remove specific sections.
It was a fiddly work, but I finally figured it out. 

### R1D3
**Today's progress:** Learned how to connect an Android app with a Parse server and worked on my website.

### R1D4
**Today's progress:** Implemented user login and sign up in an Android app with a 
Parse server and migrated the app to AndroidX

### R1D5
**Today's progress:** Migrated a website from old to new domain and hopefully did the migration SEO optimized 
(301 redirects, address change in Google Search console, database corrections). Also, played around with AndroidStudio

### R1D6
**Today's progress:** Learned how to upload and download pictures from/to a Parse Server
server - well theoretically. Unfortunately there is some error that the pictures cannot 
be viewed in the Parse dashboard and also the download through the app is not possible :/

### R1D7
**Today's progress:** Learned a bit about bluetooth implementation in Android and about version control in 
AndroidStudio. I also started with a very simplified version of a twitter clone.

### R1D8
**Today's progress:** Finished the "Complete Android Development..." course on Udemy. Learned about Firebase, app-marketing,
augmented realtiy and more.

### R1D9
**Today's progress:** Started my work on a new Android app. Didn't really code but put my ideas together, looked for 
competition products and created first sketches for my future design.

### R1D10
**Today's progress:** Drew scetches for a new app and created some first wireframes in InVisionApp. That tool is 
incredible. If you also need to create some wireframes, try it. It's free.

### R1D11
**Today's progress:** Tried to set custom colors for the Progress Bar in AndroidStudio for API<21 but I still have no solution.
Also, created the XML file for a RecyclerView-Item.

### R1D12
**Today's progress:** Created an XML-layout for a horizontal progress bar in AndroidStudio and also my own RecyclerView-Adapter.

### R1D13
**Today's progress:** Implemented SQLite in my AndroidStudio project. Still trying to figure out if it would be best to 
save the whole SQL database in an ArrayList and read from the ArrayList, or directly from the database. 

### R1D14
**Today's progress:** Replaced my "direct" SQLite integration with Room. Was kind of a long process but I think I got it now.

### R1D15
**Today's progress:** Worked on SQL queries and wondering if a huge query is better (performance) to get all the information at once,
or if I should create multiple queries, temporarily store the results of these queries and then bind them together.

### R1D16
**Today's progress:** Implemented transactions into my AndroidStudio project. A couple of more days and the code for the 
MainActivity should be finished.

### R1D17
**Today's progress:** Implemented another SQL query in my AndroidStudio project and tried to set up a background task which get's killed 
when the activity is killed. Still not sure if it works the way I want.

### R1D18
**Today's progress:** Worked around 6 hours on a problem which was actually pretty easy to solve

### R1D19
**Today's progress:** Set up a new activity in a project. Found the function View.GONE in AndroidStudio (awesome), managed to get the softInput-keyboard 
shown exactly when I want it to be shown and lots of other stuff.
Today was easier than the last days . Can't complain.

### R1D20
**Today's progress:** Didn't really code much interesting stuff today. Just worked on the XML files and implemented a couple of new connections to the database.

### R1D21
**Today's progress:** Implemented insert-, delete- and onClick-methods for a RecyclerView in AndroidStudio which is connected to a Room database. 
Was a bit of a challenge, as I wanted to change the item positions in the RecyclerView in a specific way depending on input.

### R1D22
**Today's progress:** Just worked on a TextWatcher in AndroidStudio to show errors when the user doesn't input the correct date format.

### R1D23&D24
**Today's progress:** Implemented a settings activity in my AndroidStudio project. 
Somehow my code is not getting cleaner... 

### R1D25
**Today's progress:** Implemented a RecyclerView in AndroidStudio. It's for editing and ordering categories and it has a drag and drop function. All changes are of 
course saved to the database (Room). Took me quite a time for this.
