The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [October 24, Thursday, 2019].

## Log

### R1D1 
**Today's progress:** Created a small app which gets multiple webpage ids through an API and afterwards calls the details 
of each webpage (title, URL). The titles are then shown in a list view and when clicking on them,
the webpage get's opened in a webview inside the app.
I've also set up GitHub to log my progress.

### R1D2
**Today's progress:** Mainly worked on my new website. I implemented a new theme and manipulated some parts of the theme
to remove specific sections.
It was a fiddly work, but I finally figured it out. 

### R1D3
**Today's progress:** Learned how to connect an Android app with a Parse server and worked on my website.

### R1D4
**Today's progress:** Implemented user login and sign up in an Android app with a 
Parse server and migrated the app to AndroidX

### R1D5
**Today's progress:** Migrated a website from old to new domain and hopefully did the migration SEO optimized 
(301 redirects, address change in Google Search console, database corrections). Also, played around with #AndroidStudio

### R1D6
**Today's progress:** Learned how to upload and download pictures from/to a Parse Server
server - well theoretically. Unfortunately there is some error that the pictures cannot 
be viewed in the Parse dashboard and also the download through the app is not possible :/
