# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - Leon Renner

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [October 24, Thursday, 2019].

## Log

### R1D1 
**Today's progress:** Created a small app which gets multiple webpage ids through an API and afterwards calls the details 
of each webpage (title, URL). The titles are then shown in a list view and when clicking on them,
the webpage get's opened in a webview inside the app.
I've also set up GitHub to log my progress.

### R1D2
**Today's progress:** Mainly worked on my new website. I implemented a new theme and manipulated some parts of the theme
to remove specific sections.
It was a fiddly work, but I finally figured it out. 

### R1D3
**Today's progress:** Learned how to connect an Android app with a Parse server and worked on my website.

### R1D4
**Today's progress:** Implemented user login and sign up in an Android app with a 
Parse server and migrated the app to AndroidX

### R1D5
**Today's progress:** Migrated a website from old to new domain and hopefully did the migration SEO optimized 
(301 redirects, address change in Google Search console, database corrections). Also, played around with AndroidStudio

### R1D6
**Today's progress:** Learned how to upload and download pictures from/to a Parse Server
server - well theoretically. Unfortunately there is some error that the pictures cannot 
be viewed in the Parse dashboard and also the download through the app is not possible :/

### R1D7
**Today's progress:** Learned a bit about bluetooth implementation in Android and about version control in 
AndroidStudio. I also started with a very simplified version of a twitter clone.

### R1D8
**Today's progress:** Finished the "Complete Android Development..." course on Udemy. Learned about Firebase, app-marketing,
augmented realtiy and more.

### R1D9
**Today's progress:** Started my work on a new Android app. Didn't really code but put my ideas together, looked for 
competition products and created first sketches for my future design.

### R1D10
**Today's progress:** Drew scetches for a new app and created some first wireframes in InVisionApp. That tool is 
incredible. If you also need to create some wireframes, try it. It's free.

### R1D11
**Today's progress:** Tried to set custom colors for the Progress Bar in AndroidStudio for API<21 but I still have no solution.
Also, created the XML file for a RecyclerView-Item.

### R1D12
**Today's progress:** Created an XML-layout for a horizontal progress bar in AndroidStudio and also my own RecyclerView-Adapter.

### R1D13
**Today's progress:** Implemented SQLite in my AndroidStudio project. Still trying to figure out if it would be best to 
save the whole SQL database in an ArrayList and read from the ArrayList, or directly from the database. 

### R1D14
**Today's progress:** Replaced my "direct" SQLite integration with Room. Was kind of a long process but I think I got it now.

### R1D15
**Today's progress:** Worked on SQL queries and wondering if a huge query is better (performance) to get all the information at once,
or if I should create multiple queries, temporarily store the results of these queries and then bind them together.
