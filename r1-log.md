### R1D1 
**Today's progress:** Created a small app which gets multiple webpage ids through an API and afterwards calls the details 
of each webpage (title, URL). The titles are then shown in a list view and when clicking on them,
the webpage get's opened in a webview inside the app.
I've also set up GitHub to log my progress.

### R1D2
**Today's progress:** Mainly worked on my new website. I implemented a new theme and manipulated some parts of the theme
to remove specific sections.
It was a fiddly work, but I finally figured it out.
